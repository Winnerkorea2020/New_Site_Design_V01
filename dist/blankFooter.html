                In order to ensure BITYPEER remains a safe platform for all of our users, and for us to comply with
                mandatory legal obligations which we are subjected to, we may require you to verify your identity to
                access the Services we offer. Identity verification may be required when you create advertisements, pass
                certain trade volume limits, during trade disputes, fraud investigations, and to ensure account
                ownership. As part of our ID verification process we require you to provide us with your full name as

              <h4>Bitcoin Trading</h4>
              <p class="py-2">
                You can place one or more advertisements on our platform when you wish to offer to buy or sell bitcoins.
                We have the right to restrict the number of your advertisements for security reasons and reasons of
                suspected misconduct or fraudulent activity.
              </p>
              <p class="py-2">
                Bitcoin trades ("trade" or "contact") to either buy or sell bitcoins are initiated by responding with a
                trade request to advertisements created by other users. With the trade request you are making a legally
                binding offer and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the trade (such as exchange rate,
                bitcoin amount and terms of payment) as determined by the advertiser to whom you are sending the trade
                request to. When sending the trade request, you may need to select from options made available in the
                advertisements or accept any freeform terms and conditions set out by the advertiser in the Terms of
                trade field and displayed on the advertisement page. The terms and conditions of the trade must be in
                accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In case of discrepancy, the terms of this Agreement will
                have precedence.
              </p>
              <p class="py-2">
                When you are selling bitcoin it is your responsibility to check that you have received payment for the
                full amount, that the payment is not made by a third party to the trade without that party’s
                authorisation, and that it was made according to your instructions given to the buyer. After you have
                released a trade to the buyer it is not possible to cancel, reverse, dispute or otherwise recover or
                return the bitcoins to you.
              </p>

              <p class="py-2">
                Payments made by buyers must be sent by the same person or entity who is the holder of the account or
                the company account unless authorised in writing by the payeer. Receiving, making, providing, or
                attempting to receive, make or provide payments to or from third parties is forbidden and considered a
                violation of this Agreement unless authorised by the third party.

                it is readily available for BITYPEER support staff to review. Consequently, communications on our
                platform are not considered private communications between you and other users, but BITYPEER is also a

              <h4>Disputing Bitcoin Trades</h4>
              <p class="py-2">
                When a buyer and a seller are in disagreement over a trade, either party or BITYPEER can start a dispute
                ("disputed trade” or "dispute") to initiate a mediation process on the bitcoin held in escrow. Disputed
                trades are reviewed and resolved by BITYPEER support staff.
              </p>
              <p class="py-2">
                Disputes can only be started on trades that are open and marked as paid by the buyer but not yet
                released by the seller. Trades that are not marked as paid by the buyer, have been released by the
                seller, or already disputed and resolved are considered completed and cannot be disputed, reversed, or
                altered. BITYPEER support has the right to re-open trades when the payment has been made but the trade
                has been cancelled.
              </p>
              <p class="py-2">
                BITYPEER does not become a guarantor of any party’s performance of a trade. Therefore, although BITYPEER
                helps in resolving disputes, you assume the risk that any party with whom you trade ( “counterparty”)
                fails to perform in accordance with your agreement with the counterparty. By using BITYPEER’ Services,
                you release BITYPEER from any liability arising out of or related to a counterparty’s failure to perform
                as agreed.

              <p class="py-2 ">
                Unresponsiveness
                <br />
                When you have placed advertisements which have not expired or you are involved in a bitcoin trade, it is
                important that you remain active and available at least until the trade is completed, canceled, or
                resolved. This means that you must be able to provide a response to a request by BITYPEER support in a
                disputed trade within twenty-four (24) hours or you may be deemed as unresponsive and the dispute may be
                resolved against you for this reason alone.

                Dispute review
                <br />
                During a dispute review BITYPEER support may give you instructions that you are required to follow. The
                instructions given to you may require you to provide proof of payment, proof that you have or have not
                received payment (e.g. bank transaction history), additional ID verification, photo; audio; or video
                evidence, or any other documents deemed relevant by BITYPEER. Failure to follow the instructions may
                lead to the dispute being resolved against you.
              </p>

              <p class="py-2 ">
                Dispute resolution criteria
                <br />
                A disputed trade is most commonly resolved by BITYPEER support moving the escrowed bitcoin to the buyer
                or the seller of the disputed trade once the dispute resolution criteria are met. In rare situations
                where neither party fulfills the criteria, or it is in other ways unclear or not possible to determine
                which party has fulfilled the dispute resolution criteria, BITYPEER may decide to resolve the dispute by
                splitting the escrowed bitcoin between the buyer and the seller evenly or unevenly.
              </p>
